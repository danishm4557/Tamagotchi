Tamagotchi Game
----------------
A Tamagotchi is a virtual pet which needs food, sleep, and attention similarly to as a live pet would.

HOW TO PLAY: <br>
Left Button: FEED <br>
Middle Button: ENTERTAIN <br>
Right Button: SLEEP <br>

The goal of this game is to keep this pet alive for as long as possible by porviding the baby Tamagotchi the support it needs. <br>
It will continously inform you of its hunger, boredom, and tiredness level. <br>
CAUTION -- At any point, if either one of those levels of needs reaches 20, the Tamagotchi will die! <br>
Those levels may only go down by providing the Tamagotchi the support it needs. <br>
And as this pet grows older, it will continue to grow in its size. <br>
